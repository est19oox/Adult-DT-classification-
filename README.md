# Implement from scratch Decision Tree classification method to predict whether  the incomes exceed $50K/yr based on census data

# Objectives

(1) Implement two DT models by choosing any two (2) split criteria from Information Gain, Gain Ratio, 
Gini Index and Variance. Note that you can use either binary-split or multiple-split. 

(2) Use (approximately) 2/3 records in “adult.data” for training, and 1/3 records in “adult.data” for postpruning. 
(3) Report the accuracy of each model.

(4) All DT models must be self-implemented. You CANNOT use any machine learning library in this 
task.

(5) It is recommended that your implementation includes a “tree induction function”, a “classification 
function” and a “post-pruning function”.

(6) You can (but not must) use any suitable pre-processing method. You also can (but not must) use any 
reasonable early stopping criteria (pre-pruned parameters such as number of splits, minimum data set 
size, and split threshold) to improve the training speed. If you do so, explain your reasons. 

(7) Present clear and accurate explanation of your implementation and results (in the Markdown 
format)
